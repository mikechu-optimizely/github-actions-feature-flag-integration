# Feature Flag Cleanup Solution: Phased Task Plan

Instructions: 
1. Work on the parent task you were given by title which should have a status of `WIP`.
2. Read your selected task's description and sub-tasks
3. Read the [docs/tdd.md] file to understand the task structure and requirements
4. Read the [docs/prd.md] file for functional requirements and acceptance criteria
5. Complete the sub-tasks in order, marking them with a markdown checkbox `[x]` when done
6. Once all sub-tasks are completed, mark the parent task as DONE and stop work saying "Task: [task name] is completed." and nothing else; no summary or explanation

Notes:
- You must work on your own it until it is completed
- Never mark a task as WIP or TODO. You may only mark it as DONE or [x] if it is completed
- If you need more guidance from the user, pause your task and ask for clarification
- If you find the sub-task is already completed, mark it as `[x]` and move on to the next sub-task
- There will be other agents working on different tasks, so ensure you don't duplicate work by reading the files and checking existing patterns
