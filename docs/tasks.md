# Feature Flag Synchronization Solution: Phased Task Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [x] Set up Deno 2.x runtime and TypeScript 5.x environment
- [x] Establish project structure as per TDD
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [x] Implement configuration management and environment variable loading

## Phase 2: Optimizely API Integration & Flag Discovery
- [x] Create Optimizely API client with authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- [x] Fetch all feature flag keys from Optimizely (API integration)
- [x] Implement audit logging and reporting module
- [x] Add security utilities for token validation and data sanitization

## Phase 3: Codebase Search & Flag Usage Analysis
- [x] Search codebase for each Optimizely flag key (string search, context-aware)
- [x] Exclude comments, test fixtures, and documentation from search
- [x] Report or archive flags not found in code (with audit logging)
- [x] Generate summary and compliance reports as CI artifacts

## Phase 4: Code Analysis & Multi-Language Support
- [x] Develop code analysis module for advanced flag reference extraction
- [x] Support multiple languages (JS, TS, Python, Java, C#, Go, PHP)
- [x] Implement extraction and validation of feature flag references (pattern-based)
- [x] Generate flag usage and delta reports

## Phase 5: Flag Synchronization Core
- [ ] Build flag sync core module for lifecycle operations
- [ ] Implement sync plan creation and execution
- [ ] Enable flag creation, update, and archiving
- [ ] Ensure consistency checks across environments

## Phase 6: Environment Mapping & Promotion
- [ ] Develop environment mapping module
- [ ] Support flexible environment hierarchies and promotion chains
- [ ] Map deployment environments to Optimizely environments
- [ ] Validate environment configuration and relationships

## Phase 7: Monitoring, Performance, and Observability
- [ ] Add metrics collection for sync performance and health
- [ ] Implement alerting for errors, performance, and compliance
- [ ] Optimize for parallel processing and API efficiency

## Phase 8: Documentation & Adoption
- [ ] Document configuration, usage, and troubleshooting
- [ ] Provide onboarding guide for developers and DevOps
- [ ] Collect feedback and iterate on solution
