# Feature Flag Cleanup Solution: Phased Task Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [x] Set up Deno 2.x runtime and TypeScript 5.x environment
- [x] Establish project structure as per TDD
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [x] Implement configuration management and environment variable loading

## Phase 2: Optimizely API Integration & Flag Discovery
- [x] Create Optimizely API client with authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- [x] Fetch all feature flag keys from Optimizely (API integration)
- [x] Implement audit logging and reporting module
- [x] Add security utilities for token validation and data sanitization

## Phase 3: Codebase Search & Flag Usage Analysis
- [x] Search codebase for each Optimizely flag key (string search, context-aware)
- [x] Exclude comments, test fixtures, and documentation from search
- [x] Report or archive flags not found in code (with audit logging)
- [x] Generate summary and compliance reports as CI artifacts

## Phase 4: Code Analysis & Multi-Language Support
- [x] Develop code analysis module for advanced flag reference extraction
- [x] Support multiple languages (JS, TS, Python, Java, C#, Go, PHP)
- [x] Implement extraction and validation of feature flag references (pattern-based)
- [x] Generate flag usage and delta reports

## Phase 5: Flag Cleanup Core
- [ ] Build flag cleanup core module for lifecycle operations
- [ ] Implement cleanup plan creation and execution
- [ ] Enable flag archiving operations
- [ ] Ensure consistency checks for cleanup operations
