# Product Requirements Document: Feature Flag Synchronization GitHub Action

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a **GitHub Marketplace Action** that provides automated feature flag synchronization between code deployments and Optimizely Feature Experimentation environments. This Action will be published to the GitHub Marketplace, allowing any repository to integrate feature flag cleanup capabilities via standard GitHub Actions workflow syntax (`uses: optimizely/feature-flag-sync-action@v1`).

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Feature Flag Debt**: Developers remove feature flags from code but forget to archive corresponding flags in Optimizely, leading to orphaned flags, configuration drift, and larger Optimizely JSON datafiles
2. **Manual Process Overhead**: Current manual processes for flag management are error-prone and time-consuming

### Business Impact

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce configuration drift and maintenance overhead caused by orphaned feature flags
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminate manual feature flag cleanup overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Streamline development workflows and reduce cognitive load
- **Governance**: Ensure proper feature flag lifecycle management and compliance

## Solution Overview

### Core Objectives

1. **Marketplace Distribution**: Publish a reusable GitHub Action to the Marketplace for ecosystem-wide adoption
2. **Automated Cleanup**: Automatically detect and archive feature flags that have been removed from code
3. **Consistency Assurance**: Maintain alignment between code state and Optimizely feature flag configurations
4. **Operational Transparency**: Provide visibility into feature flag synchronization activities via PR comments and reports
5. **Easy Integration**: Enable any repository to add feature flag sync with minimal workflow configuration

## Functional Requirements

### Feature Flag Removal Detection and Cleanup

#### FR1.1 Code Analysis
- **Requirement**: Solution shall scan code repositories to identify feature flag references
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Detect feature flag references across multiple programming languages
  - Identify when feature flags are removed from code
  - Generate reports of active vs. referenced feature flags

#### FR1.2 Optimizely Flag Status Verification
- **Requirement**: Solution shall query Optimizely APIs to determine current flag status
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Retrieve flag status across all relevant environments
  - Validate flag configurations and targeting rules

#### FR1.3 Automated Flag Deactivation
- **Requirement**: Solution shall automatically disable feature flags
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Disable flags that are being removed in code
  - Maintain audit trail of all flag modifications

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

#### NFR1 Scalability
- **Requirement**: Solution shall handle large codebases efficiently
- **Metrics**: Process repositories with 100k+ lines of code within 5 minutes

### Security Requirements

#### NFR2 Authentication and Authorization
- **Requirement**: Solution shall securely authenticate with Optimizely APIs and code repositories
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support proper API key authentication
  - Implement least-privilege access principles against an Optimizely service account
  - Secure credential storage and rotation

#### NFR3 Audit and Compliance
- **Requirement**: Solution shall maintain comprehensive audit logs
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Log all feature flag modifications with timestamps
  - Provide audit reports upon completion for compliance requirements
  - Support data retention policies

### Integration Requirements

#### NFR4 API Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Solution shall integrate with Optimizely Feature Experimentation APIs
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support current and future API versions via configurable endpoints
  - Handle API rate limiting, parallelization, and error conditions gracefully
  - Provide fallback mechanisms for API unavailability
- **Reference**: See [example-api-requests-responses.md](dev-artifacts/example-api-requests-responses.md) for detailed API integration patterns

## User Stories

### As a Repository Owner
- **Story**: I want to easily add feature flag synchronization to my repository by adding a single GitHub Action to my workflow
- **Acceptance Criteria**: I can add `uses: optimizely/feature-flag-sync-action@v1` to my workflow with minimal configuration and get automatic flag cleanup

### As a Developer
- **Story**: I want orphaned feature flags to be automatically cleaned up when I remove them from code so that I don't have to remember to archive them manually
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Feature flags are automatically archived in Optimizely when they are no longer referenced in the codebase

### As a Product Manager
- **Story**: I want visibility into feature flag synchronization activities so that I can understand the impact of flag changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CI output shows flag synchronization status, history, and any issues requiring attention with PR comments and status badges

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Optimizely Feature Experimentation APIs remain stable and available
- Code repositories follow consistent feature flag naming conventions
- Development teams follow established deployment pipeline processes
- Network connectivity between systems is reliable

### Constraints
- Must comply with existing security and compliance requirements
- Integration must not disrupt current development workflows
- Solution must be cost-effective and scalable
- Must support multiple programming languages and frameworks

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Optimizely Feature Experimentation API availability and functionality
- Optimizely API service account token for authentication against a configured service account user
- Access to code repositories
- Organizational approval for automated feature flag management
- Development team adoption and documentation
- GitHub Marketplace publication and distribution

**Integration Examples**: See [example-workflow.yml](dev-artifacts/example-workflow.yml) for consumer integration patterns and [packaging-strategy.md](dev-artifacts/packaging-strategy.md) for distribution strategy.

### Risks
- **Technical Risk**: API rate limiting or service unavailability
- **Operational Risk**: Incorrect flag deactivation causing service disruption
- **Adoption Risk**: Developer resistance to automated processes
- **Integration Risk**: Compatibility issues with existing toolchain

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation processes
- Provide override mechanisms for automated decisions 
- Establish rollback procedures for all flag modifications (for example un-archiving flags if needed)
- Create extensive documentation

## Conclusion

This solution will meaningfully improve the reliability and efficiency of feature flag management by automating cleanup of unused feature flags in Optimizely environments. The implementation will reduce operational overhead, minimize configuration drift, and enhance developer productivity while maintaining the flexibility and control required for enterprise-grade feature flag management.

The success of this initiative depends on careful implementation, thorough testing, and strong collaboration between development, operations, and product teams to ensure the solution meets both technical requirements and business objectives.
