# Product Requirements Document: Feature Flag Synchronization Solution

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for an automated feature flag synchronization solution that ensures consistency between code deployments and Optimizely Feature Experimentation environments. The solution addresses two critical scenarios: automatic cleanup of unused feature flags and promotion of feature flags across environments during the software development lifecycle.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Feature Flag Debt**: Developers remove feature flags from code but forget to archive corresponding flags in Optimizely, leading to orphaned flags, configuration drift, and larger Optimizely JSON datafiles
2. **Environment Synchronization**: Feature flags referenced in code are not automatically created or synchronized across Optimizely environments during promotion workflows
3. **Manual Process Overhead**: Current manual processes for flag management are error-prone and time-consuming

### Business Impact

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce deployment risks caused by feature flag inconsistencies
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminate manual feature flag management overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Streamline development workflows and reduce cognitive load
- **Governance**: Ensure proper feature flag lifecycle management and compliance

## Solution Overview

### Core Objectives

1. **Automated Cleanup**: Automatically detect and archive feature flags that have been removed from code
2. **Environment Promotion**: Seamlessly synchronize feature flags across environments during code promotion
3. **Consistency Assurance**: Maintain alignment between code state and Optimizely feature flag configurations
4. **Operational Transparency**: Provide visibility into feature flag synchronization activities

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support proper API key authentication
  - Implement least-privilege access principles against an Optimizely service account
  - Secure credential storage and rotation

#### NFR3 Audit and Compliance
- **Requirement**: Solution shall maintain comprehensive audit logs
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Log all feature flag modifications with timestamps
  - Provide audit reports upon completion for compliance requirements
  - Support data retention policies

### Integration Requirements

#### NFR4 API Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Solution shall integrate with Optimizely Feature Experimentation APIs
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support current and future API versions via configurable endpoints
  - Handle API rate limiting, parallelization, and error conditions gracefully
  - Provide fallback mechanisms for API unavailability

## User Stories

### As a DevOps Engineer
- **Story**: I want feature flags to be automatically synchronized during deployments so that I don't have to manually manage flag states across environments
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Feature flags are automatically duplicated in target environments during deployment pipeline execution

### As a Developer
- **Story**: I want orphaned feature flags to be automatically cleaned up when I remove them from code so that I don't have to remember to archive them manually
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Feature flags are automatically archived in Optimizely when they are no longer referenced in the codebase

### As a Product Manager
- **Story**: I want visibility into feature flag synchronization activities so that I can understand the impact of flag changes across environments
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CI output shows flag synchronization status, history, and any issues requiring attention

### As a Platform Engineer
- **Story**: I want to configure synchronization rules and policies so that the system operates according to our organizational standards
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Administrative interface allows configuration of sync rules, approval workflows, and environment mappings

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Optimizely Feature Experimentation APIs remain stable and available
- Code repositories follow consistent feature flag naming conventions
- Development teams follow established deployment pipeline processes
- Network connectivity between systems is reliable

### Constraints
- Must comply with existing security and compliance requirements
- Integration must not disrupt current development workflows
- Solution must be cost-effective and scalable
- Must support multiple programming languages and frameworks

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Optimizely Feature Experimentation API availability and functionality
- Optimizely API service account token for authentication against a configured service account user
- Access to code repositories and CI/CD pipeline systems
- Organizational approval for automated feature flag management
- Development team adoption and documentation

### Risks
- **Technical Risk**: API rate limiting or service unavailability
- **Operational Risk**: Incorrect flag deactivation causing service disruption
- **Adoption Risk**: Developer resistance to automated processes
- **Integration Risk**: Compatibility issues with existing toolchain

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation processes
- Provide override mechanisms for automated decisions 
- Establish rollback procedures for all flag modifications (for example un-archiving flags if needed)
- Create extensive documentation

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Multi-Project Support**: Support for multiple Optimizely projects
- **Advanced Analytics**: Feature flag usage analytics reporting

### Scalability Considerations
- **Enterprise Features**: Support for complex organizational structures and approval workflows
- **Global Deployment**: Multi-region synchronization and compliance
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and batching for large-scale operations

## Conclusion

This solution will meaningfully improve the reliability and efficiency of feature flag management by automating synchronization between code and Optimizely environments. The implementation will reduce operational overhead, minimize deployment risks, and enhance developer productivity while maintaining the flexibility and control required for enterprise-grade feature flag management.

The success of this initiative depends on careful implementation, thorough testing, and strong collaboration between development, operations, and product teams to ensure the solution meets both technical requirements and business objectives.
